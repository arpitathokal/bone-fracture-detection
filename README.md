# bone-fracture-detection
Deep learning project for detecting bone fractures in X-ray images using CNNs. Utilizes MURA and FracAtlas datasets, with preprocessing, model training (e.g., ResNet), and Grad-CAM for interpretability. Final goal: deploy a user-friendly web app for real-time fracture prediction using Streamlit or Flask.
